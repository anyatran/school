For each problem below, write three solutions to the program.
The first solution should use arrays.  The second solution should
use array-style pointers.  The third solution should use pointers natively.

This time, you only need to submit it online.  For online, submissions, log onto
a Linux machine.  (For example:  ssh login.ccs.neu.edu )  Then type:
  /course/cs2600gc/submit-cs2600gc-hw3  myhw3.c
Alternatively, if you have many files in a directory, hw3, then do:
  tar cvf hw3.tar ./hw3
  gzip hw3.tar
  /course/cs2600gc/submit-cs2600gc-hw3  hw3.tar.gz
If you have never used UNIX/Linux, then look in the help directory
for help (accessible from the course web page, or from
the course directory:  /course/cs2600gc/help .

If you wrote it on Windows, and transferred it to UNIX, you may need
to edit out the extra DOS characters.  (DOS adds ^M to end of each line.)
At CCIS on Linux machines, we have a local command to do so:
  dos2unix myhw3.c myhw3.c
A version for any UNIX/Linux machine (a shell script) is provided
  at:  /coruse/cs2600gc/dos2unix

EXAMPLE (done for you):
    Recall that in C/C++, a string is stored as an array of characters,
and its type is "char *".  Recall further, that the end of a string
must be the null character (denoted '\0' in C/C++).  Note that the
characters "%d" inside a format string of printf mean:  replace %d with
the next printf argument, in decimal integer format.  Write a program
to copy a string from the array, x1, to the array x2.  Assume that
the string x1 is already initialized as "Hello, world." .
Also, print out the length of the string.

Solution A (arrays):

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char x1[100] = "Hello, world.";
  char x2[100];  /* can hold up to 100 characters, including '\0' */
  int i = 0;
  while (x1[i] != '\0') {
    x2[i] = x1[i];
    i++;
  }
  x2[i] = x1[i];
  printf( "The length of the string is %d (not incl. null char).\n", i );
}


Solution B (array-style pointers):

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char x1[100] = "Hello, world.";
  char x2[100];  /* can hold up to 100 characters, including '\0' */
  int i = 0;
  char *x1ptr = x1, *x2ptr = x2;
  while (*(x1ptr + i) != '\0') {
    *(x2ptr + i) = *(x1ptr + i);
    i++;
  }
  *(x2ptr + i) = *(x1ptr + i);
  printf( "The length of the string is %d (not incl. null char).\n", i );
}


Solution C (native pointers):

#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char x1[100] = "Hello, world.";
  char x2[100];  /* can hold up to 100 characters, including '\0' */
  char *x1ptr = x1, *x2ptr = x2;
  while (*x1ptr != '\0') {
    *x2ptr++ = *x1ptr++;
    /* Recall that ++ after the variable does post-increment.
       It uses the variable first, and then it increments. */
  }
  *x2ptr = *x1ptr;
   printf( "The length of the string is %d (not incl. null char).\n",
           x2ptr - x2 );
}

======================================================================
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

1.  Chapter 1.5.4 of our optional text on C has a program to count lines, words
and characters in a string.  (There is a copy of it in the course directory
as hw3-example-program1.c )  That program assumes that we read from standard
input using getchar().  To simplify, you will instead use the initialized
string array:
  char x1[100] = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.";
(Of course this example has only one line.  Also, you must modify
the logic to recognize '\0' instead of EOF.  EOF stands for end-of-file.)
Write the three solutions for this program.


2.  Chapter 1.6 of our optional text on C has a program to count the number of
occurrences of each digit, of white space characters, and of all other
characters.  (There is a copy of it in the course directory
as hw3-example-program2.c. ) That program assumes that we read from standard
input using getchar().  To simplify, you will instead use the initialized
string array:
 char x1[100]
   = "The 25 quick brown foxes jumped over the 27 lazy dogs 17 times.";
(Of course this example has only one line.  Also, you must modify
the logic to recognize '\0' instead of EOF.  EOF stands for end-of-file.)
Write the three solutions for this program.  Note that the array, ndigit,
of that program will also have to be converted to pointers.
