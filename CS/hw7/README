			DUE: Wednesday, Nov. 19

This assignment requires the use of POSIX system calls and the C
programming language.  Your CCIS account allows you to do all of this
assignment (and it provides the productivity tools, GDB, Makefile,
and VI/EMACS).  You may develop the code on a different computer if you
wish, but the computer will still be tested on a CCIS computer.
Hence, it is recommended to develop directly on a CCIS computer.

A Makefile is provided for you in this directory.  It allows you to do
things like:
  make run
  make vi
  make emacs
  make gdb

For the API to call the various POSIX threads functions, please use:
  man 3 NAME
(For example, see 'man 3 pthread_create', for pthread_create.)

Some important POSIX thread functions that you will want to be familiar
with are:
  pthread_create    [ Creates a new thread ]
  pthread_mutex_init
  pthread_mutex_lock
  pthread_mutex_unlock

Note that most pthread system calls require the header in the C source code:
#include <pthread.h>

Furthermore, when compiling them, you will typically have to explicitly
invoke the pthread library.  A typical compiler command is:
           gcc -g -O0 -o myprog myprog.c -lpthread
[ Here, I include "-g -O0" to make it easy to run your program with GDB:
    gdb myprog
]

[ Do not worry about pthread_mutex_destroy.  Most programs create only a
  small number of mutexes.  They don't bother to explicitly destroy
  them, since they will be destroyed on process exit. ]

This assignment has three parts.

====
PART I:

    Implement the functions:
  sem_init
  sem_post
  sem_wait
where these functions should have the same signature as found in
'man 3 sem_init', 'man 3 sem_post', 'man 3 sem_wait'.  (These three functions
are already defined in the pthread library.  When you compile this, you will
be writing your own definition of these functions.  Any definition in your
program automatically supersedes any definition in a library (e.g., pthread
library).)

====
PART II:

  Test your definitions of sem_init, sem_post, sem_wait, of these
three functions.  Your program should create two threads, a producer
thread and a consumer thread.  You will also create a buffer with
four slots.
  int buffer[4];
Each thread will wait a random amount of time, by invoking:
  sleep( rand() % 5 );
(See 'man 3 rand' for the definition of the rand system call.)

PRODUCER THREAD:
After waiting this random amount of time, the producer thread
will then write an integer into the next available slot in the buffer.
The producer will then loop back and again call 'sleep' over a random
period of time.  The first integer written will be '1'.  On each
iteration, it will continue by writing '2', '3', etc.

CONSUMER THREAD:
After waiting a random amount of time, the consumer thread
will then read an integer from the next available slot in the buffer.
The consumer thread will then print the integer, and loop back and again
call 'sleep' over a random period of time.

If your program works, you should expect to see 1, 2, 3, ... being
printed to your screen.

====
PART III:

Extend the above code to work with three producer threads and three
consumer threads.

If your program works, you should expect to see 1, 2, 3, ... being
printed to your screen.  However, each integer will eventually be
printed three times, since there are three producers, each of which
is printing 1, 2, 3, ....  Naturally, the three copies of each integer
may appear in a somewhat random order as part of the full sequence
of integers.
