			Homework 4
		Due:  Wednesday, October 15, 2014

The assignment is in hw4.assignment.  It uses code in hw4.c .

The provided source code implements a small shell.
Note that the command "make" looks for a default file, "Makefile",
   in the current directory, and then executes the commands in "Makefile".
To test it, cd to this directory, and try:
  make
  % ls
  % ls -l
  % exit

# NEXT, NOTE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE EXECUTE OUR SHELL PROGRAM RECURSIVELY.
  ./myshell
  % ls
  % myshell
  % exit
  % exit

# BUG 1:  '#' should be the comment character in the shell.
  ./myshell
  % ls # This is a comment.
# COMMENT:
# It's okay if your shell does not handle:  ls# comment
#   AS LONG AS IT HANDLES:  ls # comment

# BUG 2:  We can't read a script file containing a list of commands.
# We would like to execute:  ./myshell script.myshell
#   and have the commands in script.myshell executed.
# When you fix this bug, you will gain access to the UNIX/Linux feature
#   for scripts.  This is similar to the DOS feature for batch files: .bat
#   For example, consider autoexec.bat .  However, a .bat file must only
#   be interpreted by DOS, and a UNIX interpreted file can be interpreted
#   by whatever command is listed after "#!".
#   The first line of script.myshell, "#!./myshell" says this is an
#   an interpreted file, and should be executed as if it were:
#   "./myshell script.myshell"

# NEXT, NOTE SOME BUGS IN OUR myshell;
# BUG 3:  WE CAN'T INTERRUPT WITHOUT ALSO KILLING THE ENTIRE SHELL.
#         sleep 2 SLEEPS FOR 2 SECONDS.
  ./myshell
  % sleep 2
  % sleep 50
  % ^C
